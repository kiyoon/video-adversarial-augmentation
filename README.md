## Running the code

```bash
pip install -e .
cp tools/run.env tools/.env
vi tools/.env  # change the settings here

# You can change the hyperparameters using environment variables like below
export ML_num_epochs=200
export ML_batch_size=16
export ML_lr_model=1e-4
# ... see more in BaseConfig in tools/run_aug.py

accelerate launch tools/run_aug.py
```

NOTE: you don't need to download the datasets as they will be downloaded automatically.
